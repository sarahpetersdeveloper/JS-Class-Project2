# JS-Class-Project2-BoggleGame
The second should be the project you want to do, but you don't think you have enough time or resources to complete in eight weeks.

Boggle is a game where you are present with a set of squares that are N by N. Each square has a letter in it. The user must click 
a square and then another square that is adjacent to it to to form a word. For each word the user makes the get points awarded like so:

 - 1 pt for a 3 letter word
 - 2 pt for a 4 letter word
 - 3 pt for a 5 letter word
 - 10 pt for all 5+ letter words
 
 The user has 60 seconds to get as many points as possible. If a series of letters does not form a word, the user gets 0 points and has 
 to try again. If the user suceeds in making a word, they are awarded points, the word appears in their word bank, and then they may try 
 again for more points.
